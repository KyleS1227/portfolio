        <p >I am an undergraduate student at Penn State, and I am facing<b> dire </b>financial trouble. 
            To solve this issue, I've decided to sell my beloved<b> radishes </b>. 
            This was a very tough decision for me, but I need to put my future first.</p>

        <p>My collection has a variety of prized radishes. Large ones, small ones, I've got them all. 
            I even own a<i> strange </i>radish that I don't recall buying. The prices are<b> NON-NEGOTIABLE </b>, 
            and are very<i> fair </i>based on the current radish market. 
        </p>
